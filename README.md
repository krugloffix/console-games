# Console Brain Games
## Hello there!
This is a set of 5 console games to test your math skills! Each game will ask you 3 questions (and be careful traveler, write what game will ask you to, or game will be over) and your goal is to answer all the questions correct. Follow the instructions below to start the game!

## Instalation
- First of all, you'll need to download install las version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (at least 18.0.).
- Copy this repo to your computer
- Run console in the core of the project and print 
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
- That's all!

## Games
Next step is to chose the game and test yourself. 
- brain-even; A game to check the parity of a number.
- brain-calc; A game to check your calculation skills.
- brain-gcd; A game for you to find greatest common divisor.
- brain-progression; A game where you need to fidn missing number in arithmetic progression.
- brain-prime; A game to check is number prime or not.

When you choose a game you want to play, write in the console 
```sh
brain-(name)
```
or (if you use windows) 
```sh
npx brain-(name)
```

### Good luck and have fun!
